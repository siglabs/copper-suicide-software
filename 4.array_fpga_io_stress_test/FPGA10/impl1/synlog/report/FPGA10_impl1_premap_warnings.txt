@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\cu_suicide_heat_test\fpga10\fpga10.v":387:0:387:5|Found inferred clock sys_pll|CLKOS_inferred_clock which controls 60 sequential elements including IL12_125[12]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
